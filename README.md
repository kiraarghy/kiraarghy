### Ahoy there! ⚓️

🥳  I'm Kara, the wonderful entustee of the username @kiraarghy. 

🎥  You may know of me from similar programs such as @FormidableLabs or [twitter](https://twitter.com/KiraArghy).

👩🏻‍💻  Most of my day is spent coding the websites you love and use, but when I'm not doing that...

✍️  I handcode SVGs on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/AZvEzJ)! Please ask me more about this!

🤷‍♀️  I make things that nobody needs or asked for [React 7 segment display](https://codesandbox.io/s/sevensegmentexample-wcpg2) and [hairmailer](https://github.com/kiraarghy/hairMailer).

✊  I'm also probably working on some sort of tech unions work through [TWC London](https://twitter.com/TechWorkersLDN).
